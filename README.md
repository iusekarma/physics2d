# 2D Physics Engine
A simply 2d physics engine which simulates motion, gravity and collisions between bodies.

This project was inspired by a youtube video by [Pezzza's Work](https://www.youtube.com/@PezzzasWork) ([video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS_qeBy3aQI)) and a playlist by [Two-Bit Coding](https://www.youtube.com/@two-bitcoding8018) ([playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSlpr6o9vURwq3oxVZSimY8iC-cdd3kIs)). Check them out for a physics engine made using C++ and C#.

Note: main.py is setup to simulate right gif (30 random circle bodies.)

Note: Only circle bodies are supported at the moment. Probably will add box bodies too.
